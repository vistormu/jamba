# Jamba: A Vim-like Minimal Text Editor

Jamba is a superfast and lightweight text editor inspired by Vim and written in Go.

It is based on the [antirez's Kilo Text Editor](http://antirez.com/news/108), and it is my attempt to port the C version to a more idiomatic Go code. Also, I extended it to resemble Vim, which has been so fun.

I highly recommend you to try and build your own text editor with [this wonderful tutorial!](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html)
